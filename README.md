Addition
Subtraction
Multiplication
Division
Power (Exponentiation)
Square Root
Area Calculations:

Area of a Square
Area of a Rectangle
Area of a Circle
Area of a Cube
Area of a Cuboid
Area of a Sphere
Usage
Initialize the Calculator: Create an instance of the Calculator class.

python
Copy code
user = Calculator()
Display the Calculator Menu: Call the simple_math_cal method to display available operations.

python
Copy code
user.simple_math_cal()
Select an Operation: Input your choice (1-7) for the desired operation.

Perform the Calculation: Based on your choice, input the required numbers to perform the calculation.

Example Usage
Hereâ€™s a step-by-step example of how to use the calculator:

python
Copy code
# Step 1: Create a calculator instance
user = Calculator()

# Step 2: Display the calculator options
user.simple_math_cal()

# Step 3: User chooses an operation, for example, Addition (1)
user_choice = int(input("Your choice: "))

# Step 4: Input the numbers for the operation
if user_choice == 1:  # Addition
    n1 = int(input("n1: "))
    n2 = int(input("n2: "))
    user.add(n1, n2)  # This will print the result of the addition
Example Operations
Addition Example:

python
Copy code
user.add(5, 3)  # Output: 8
Square Root Example:

python
Copy code
user.sqrt(16)  # Output: 4.0
Area of a Circle Example:

python
Copy code
user.circle(5)  # Output: 78.53981633974483 (area for radius 5)
Conclusion
This Calculator program is a simple and effective tool for performing mathematical calculations and area computations. It is implemented using basic Python constructs and demonstrates the use of classes and methods for organizing functionality.
